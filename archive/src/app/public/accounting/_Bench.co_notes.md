Call on 1/30/18
Notes from call with Bench.co:

1) The bookeeper only updates my books once a month

2) They don't do payroll, inventory, or accounting for bank loans but they will book a JE at the end of the month to true up the books on a monthly basis. 

3) Books are not updated in real-time

4) Cash balances are reconciled monthly so entreprenurs and business owners won't know their cash balance until the end of the month. 

5) They won't invoice customers for work performed but they will work with 3rd party vendors to do this

6) Third party vendors (for example for - Invoicing and Payroll) will seamlessly provide information to Bench and book relevant JEs at the end of the month 

7) They don't track books on an accrual basis, ONLY cash basis. 

8) They have an online portal that allows you to upload scans of reciepts and bills but you may also mail them for $30 per mailing./

9) Bench.co DOES NOTE have an app for Android, only iPhone

Ways that Oliphant Advisory can be better:

1) We are a full service CPA firm located in the US, not Canada. 
2) We do payroll in house. 
3) We do accrual bookeeping.
4) We assist in certain types of invoicing - recurring invoicing, like collecting rent, subscriptions 
5) We have an app for both Android and iPhone. 
6) We provide integration to your website so that you get paid faster and more seamlessly. 

How would we do it: 
1) For each financial statement line we would hire a technician that specializes in that account
2) Together these people form a team lead by an account manager who is trained bookeeper who is responsible for the quality of the team's work and service delivery.
3) We would use integrations (API and SDK) into quickbooks/xero to deliver a superior service
4) Allow clients to be as hands-on as they wish - they can either login to our portal and view their FS and cash balance along with some details about when their account was last reconciled, but for those more difficult issues they can login directly to their Xero account.
