Xero (1/30/2018, 11:09:40 AM): Hi there! Welcome to Xero Chat!
I'm Jj - how can I help you today? 
Me (1/30/2018, 11:10:21 AM): Hello Jj, Can you tell me if Xero supports reporting for "Accrual Basis" accounting? 
Xero (1/30/2018, 11:11:24 AM): Yes, Xero both supports Accrual and cash basis Accounting. 
Xero (1/30/2018, 11:13:42 AM): Are you planning to use the Accrual basis on your reports? 
Me (1/30/2018, 11:14:07 AM): Can you also tell me if there is an "Audit Trail" feature that allows me to trace the history of transaction? 
Xero (1/30/2018, 11:14:28 AM): If so you can use the accrual basis on your income statement: https://help.xero.com/us/ReportProfitLoss In Xero, you can Choose Accrual to display revenue earned and expenses that occurred during the date range you selected. 
Xero (1/30/2018, 11:15:19 AM): As for the Audit trail, are you referring to view the history that has been made to your Xero account? 
Xero (1/30/2018, 11:15:33 AM): Or the past activity details? 
Me (1/30/2018, 11:16:49 AM): It's a feature that I'm familiar with in QB where if you enter a Bill, and then later make changes to the Bill entered, you can look at the Audit Trail for the JE to see all the subsequent changes to the Bill and the User who made the changes.  
Xero (1/30/2018, 11:17:28 AM): One moment, please. Let me check this for you. 
Xero (1/30/2018, 11:18:48 AM): Thank you for patiently waiting. 
Me (1/30/2018, 11:18:54 AM): Thanks 
Xero (1/30/2018, 11:19:35 AM): As I checked here, The history notes / activity is the feature that you are looking. https://help.xero.com/us/HistoryNotesActivity 
Xero (1/30/2018, 11:19:53 AM): In Xero, you can View a summary of the actions made by all users to your transactions. This audit trail also shows any notes recorded against your organisation's transactions. Only users with the Adviser user role can access the History & Notes Activity report. Only Advisers who are also Payroll Admins can view payroll transactions.
